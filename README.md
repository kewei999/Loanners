# Loanners
This is our mobile application development assignment, where we are required to group a team of 4 and build an mobile application development that can help the world to be better. Loanners is a type of mobile application that aim to help to decrease the poverty by helping student apply loan in a easier way. 

Just like employee that find job, employee will choose to use centralize job portal instead of search careers on each company. This increase the chance of them to get explore with different company and it also help the employer to find the suitable candidate. 

In our app, we centralize those foundation that provide loan for student. It makes more easier for parents or teachers that hope to help their childrens or students by searching the loan in a more easier way. Plus, is much more easier to prepare related information compare to prepare hardcopy documentation (in this way, we also help to reduce paper use).
